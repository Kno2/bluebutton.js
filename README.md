# BlueButton.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/blue-button/bluebutton.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/blue-button/bluebutton.js)

BlueButton.js helps developers parse and generate complex health data formats like C-CDA with ease, so you can empower patients with access to their health records. [Try the demo.](http://blue-button.github.io/bluebutton.js/sandbox/)

## Status: not under active development

The library is no longer under active development (extending generation / parsing capabilities, etc.). The existing feature set is fairly stable, but if you want to parse or generate additional data elements, you will likely have to fork + extend the library. If you make a pull request, I can review it and try to integrate it into the main library, and if you find a bug and provide details, including a sample file to reproduce, I may be able to help fix it.

See also https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button and https://github.com/amida-tech/blue-button-generate â€“ forks which have diverged significantly but are under more active development.

## Quick Start

BlueButton.js supports a few different health data types, like C32 and CCDA. To parse a health document, pass the source data to `BlueButton`:

```JavaScript
var myRecord = BlueButton(xml);
```

BlueButton.js will detect the document type and choose the appropriate parser. The returned object has the following properties:

```JavaScript
myRecord.type    // The document type
myRecord.source  // The parsed source data with added querying methods
myRecord.data    // The final parsed document data
```

## Detailed Documentation

[View the documentation](http://blue-button.github.io/bluebutton.js/docs) for an explanation of the data sections, much more detailed sample code, instructions on how to generate a build, etc.

## Royal Jay Updates

There are a number of pre parsed sections for CCDA and C32 documents.  In the orignal bluebutton.js the section name was a key off of
the data object containing an array of entries. Those sections now contain an object vs an array with the following properties.

```
{
  displayName: "friendly display name",
  templateId: "",
  text: "<div>Some HTML for section</div>",
  entries: []
}
```

1. **displayName** - Friendly name to display in viewer.
2. **templateId** - The HL7 templateId for the section. This currently isn't filled for the pre parsed sections such as allergies, medications, etc. For any generically created section, there will be a template id.
3. **text** - the narrative text (generally HTML) for each section.  All the objects on data outside of demographics, document and smoking status should have this value set.  We can default to displaying this HTML if there is no custom section display.
4. **entries** - the original array of entries

### Generic sections

We've also modified BlueButton.js to include generic sections.  These are sections where a specific templateId isn't present in section mapping function for c32, ccd, etc.  Generic sections only parse out narrative text, displayName and templateId.
this gave us the ability to still display and filter on a section that wasn't explicitly added in the BlueButton library.
